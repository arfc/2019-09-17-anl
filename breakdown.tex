    \frametitle{Breakdown of Results}
    The goal is to set up 4 transition scenarios in which undersupply 
    and under capacity of all commodities is minimized. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item EG01-23 Constant Power Demand
        \item EG01-24 Linearly Increasing Power Demand
        \item EG01-29 Constant Power Demand
        \item EG01-30 Linearly Increasing Power Demand
    \end{enumerate}

This is achieved by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Comparison of prediction methods for each of 4 scenarios is conducted 
    to determine the best method. 
    \item Sensitivity analysis of power supply buffer is conducted to determine 
    best buffer size. 
    \item Using best prediction method and buffer size, demonstrate \deploy 
    deploying reactor and supporting facilities to meet power demand 
    for 4 scenarios. 
\end{enumerate}
