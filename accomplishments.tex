  % a comment
  \begin{itemize}
      \item[$\bullet$] The first test looks at the deployment of support
                       facilties for reactors. 
      \item[$\bullet$] In this test reactors will be deployed to met a linear
                       growth rate of 3 reactors per year. 
      \item[$\bullet$] Each reactor requires a source facility to supply it
                       per year, therefore there should be a similar growth
                       in these facilties with comparison to reactors.
