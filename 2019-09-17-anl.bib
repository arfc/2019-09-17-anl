matters in the viability of nuclear energy: spent fuel disposal
and power plants that no longer operate. The potential benefits
of siting a borehole repository at a shut down nuclear power
plant facility are analyzed from the perspective of myriad stake-
holders. This assessment indicates that integrated siting will
make economic use of the shut down power plant, take advan-
tage of spent fuel handling infrastructure at those sites, mini-
mize transportation costs, expedite emptying the crowded spent
fuel storage pools accross the country, and will do so at sites
more likely to have consenting communities.},

is run from 1950 to 2160 for EU to track the UNF mass

	title = {Current {Status} of {Predictive} {Transition} {Capability} in {Fuel} {Cycle} {Simulation}},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle simulation scenarios are most naturally described as 
constrained objective functions. The objectives are often systemic 
demands such as ``achieve 1\% growth for total electricity production 
and reach 10\% uranium utilization''. The constraints take 
the form of nuclear fuel cycle technology availability 
(``reprocessing begins after 2025 and fast reactors first become 
available in 2050'').

To match the natural constrained objective form of the scenario 
definition, NFC simulators must bring demand responsive 
deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic.

In particular, a NFC simulator should have the 
capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to enable 
a demand to be met. Take, for instance, the standard once through fuel 
cycle. Reactors may be deployed to meet a objective power demand. 
However, new mines, mills, and enrichment facilities will also need to be 
deployed to ensure that reactors have sufficient fuel to produce power.  
In many simulators, the unrealistic solution to this problem is to 
simply have infinite capacity support facilities. Alternatively, 
detailing the deployment timeline of all facilities becomes the 
responsibility of the user.

The authors seek to identify the most flexible, general, and performant 
algorithms applicable to this modeling challenge.  Accordingly, a review was 
conducted of current NFC simulation tools to determine the 
current capabilites for demand-driven and transition scenarios. 
Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic
innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains
such as economics and industrial engineering.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

A Cyclus simulation captured nuclear power deployment in the EU from 1970 to 2160. In this simulation, France begins its planned transition to SFRs as existing LWRs are decommissioned. These SFRs are fueled with UNF accumulated by other EU nations and reprocessed in France. The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and SFR breeding ratios on time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment of additional LWRs by accepting UNF from other EU nations, that lifetime extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not particularly impactful.},

	abstract = {Recent interest in advanced reactors and the following need for techno-economic transitions has increased the demand for tools necessary to model complex nuclear fuel cycles (NFCs) and advanced reactor technologies. This thesis demonstrates the capability of CYCLUS , the agent-based fuel cycle simulator, to model, simulate, and analyze real-life fuel cycle transition scenarios. I introduce new methods and tools that use various databases to model and simulate real-world nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios involving advanced reactor technologies.

The work in this thesis contains: (1) benchmarking Cyclus to other nuclear fuel cycle simulators (NFC simulators); (2) developing new methods and tools necessary for modeling and simulating real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios; (3) simulation of both domestic and international nuclear technology transitions.

The methods and tools developed for such capabilities include: (1) modeling and simulating past and current nuclear fleets using historic nuclear reactor operations database; (2) modeling individual reactors and their operating history to calculate nuclear material inventory; (3) modeling Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) behavior in a large-scale fuel cycle simulation.

Benchmark work shows that CYCLUS results coincide with results from other NFC simulators with minor differences due to modeling choices. Additionally, this thesis demonstrates the CYCLUS capability to effectively model and simulate real-life NFC transition scenarios that involve advanced reactor technologies such as MSRs.},

	abstract = {For many fuel cycle simulators, it is currently up to the user to define a deployment scheme of supporting facilities or provide an infinite inventory of commodities to ensure that there is no gap in the supply chain. To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. In this work, we develop demand driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, d3ploy. User-controlled capabilities such as supply/ capacity buffers, constraint deployment, prediction algorithms, and installed capacity deployment were introduced in d3ploy to give a user the tools to minimize commodity undersupply in a simulation. We demonstrate d3ploy{\textquoteright}s capability to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet various types of user-defined power demands: constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal.},

	abstract = {In many fuel cycle simulators, the user must define a deployment scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid supply chain gaps. To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulators should bring demand-responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. Thus, a next-generation NFC simulator should predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined power demand. CYCLUS is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework [4]. In CYCLUS, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel cycle is an agent. Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution and facility agents can be grouped into. Institution agents control the deployment and decommission of facility agents and represents legal operating organizations such as a utility, government, etc. Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. CYCAMORE provides agents to represent process physics of various components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment facility, reactor). The Demand-Driven CYCAMORE Archetypes project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop CYCLUS{\textquoteright} demand-driven deployment capabilities. This capability is added as a CYCLUS Institution agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. This demand-driven deployment capability is called d3ploy. In this paper, we explain the capabilities of d3ploy and demonstrate how d3ploy minimizes undersupply of all commodities in a few simulations while meeting key simulation constraints. Constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand transition scenarios are demonstrated. Insights are discussed to inform parameter input decisions for future work in setting up larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. And finally, the more complex transition scenarios are demonstrated.},

of libraries [2] that have been contibuted to the C YCLUS

This simulation framework is incomplete without a suite
of dynamically loadable libraries representing the process
physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabri-
cation, chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing,
etc.). Within Cycamore [3], the additional modules reposi-
tory within the C YCLUS ecosystem, provides some basic li-
braries to represent these processes. However, extension of
C YCLUS with new capabilities is community-driven, rely-
ing on contributions by user-developers. The libraries con-
tributed in this work are examples of such contributions.},

	abstract = {The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST\&DARDS) is being developed for the U.S. Department of Energy{\textquoteright}s Office of Nuclear Energy by the national laboratories. An important part of UNF-ST\&DARDS is the Unified Database (UDB), which contains information that can support a variety of activities including fuel storage, fuel transportation, and disposal-related system analysis. Currently, the main application of the UDB is to support evaluation of the characteristics of discharged spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from the U.S. commercial reactors. However, because of the extensive amount of data that has been collected and analyzed for UNFST\&DARDS, there are many more applications that can utilize the UDB including system analysis with the Next-Generation System Analysis Model (NGSAM) and fuel cycle analysis with fuel cycle simulation codes such as ORION. Going forward, NGSAM and fuel cycle transition analysis with ORION integrate UDB data wherever possible in the UDB{\textquoteright}s development plan. These advances in NGSAM and fuel cycle analysis can be used in conjunction with the UDB to help answer more complex questions about the optimization, utilization, storage, and eventual disposal of SNF.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the results of a study that uses the thermal performance of the repository to establish chemical separations and transmutation criteria for commercial spent nuclear fuel of benefit to a geologic repository, as measured by the allowable increase in utilization of repository space. The method for determining the chemical elements to be separated is based on the thermal performance of the repository. The important chemical elements are identified, the order of importance of the separated elements is established, and the relationship between the efficiency of the chemical separation and the resulting increase in utilization is determined. The proposed repository at Yucca Mountain is used as an example of a geologic repository for the purposes of illustrating the magnitude of the benefits that are possible and the implications for repository size and operation. This work is being done in support of the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, where numerous reactor, processing, and recycling strategies are being examined to determine the impact on issues important to the viability of nuclear electricity generation, including the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste.},
