  \frametitle{Conclusion}
        These results demonstrate that by carefully selecting \deploy 
        parameters, we are able to \textbf{effectively automate deployment}
        of reactor and supporting facilities to set up 
        constant and linearly increasing power demand transition scenarios
        for EG01-23, EG01-24, EG01-29, and EG01-30 with minimal 
        power undersupply.

        \\
        Not completely eliminating undersupply and under capacity of 
        commodities in the simulation is expected 
        since without time series data 
        at the beginning of the simulation, \deploy takes a few 
        time steps to collect time series data about power demand 
        to predict and start deploying reactor and supporting 
        fuel cycle facilities.
